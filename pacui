\e[1mWelcome to PacUIs Help Page

PacUI is an interactive package manager for your command line terminal. It provides an easy user interface and uses Pacman and Trizen/Yay/Pacaur/Yaourt as back ends. If Pacaur is installed on your system, PacUI uses it by default.

Navigate this help page with your Arrow Keys, PageUp/PageDown Keys, SpaceBar, or your Mouse Wheel. To search this Help Page, enter /<SEARCH TERM> and press ENTER. For example, enter the following (without quotes " ") in order to search for the word "update": "/update". Press N key to continue searching for other occurances of "/update". Search is not case sensitive. To exit this Help Page, press your Q key.
PacUI uses Fuzzy Finder (fzf) to display selectable lists, which can be easily searched by starting to type. Advanced users can even use regular expressions to search in fzf. Use your TAB key to select multiple items from the list and your ENTER key to choose your selection. Navigate fzf's list the same way you navigate this help page.


\e[1mHOME SCREEN
PacUI's home screen is split into three parts:
The first part focuses on updates, maintenance, installations, and removals of packages from system repositories and the Arch User Repository (AUR). It includes useful tools for these actions, too.
The second part includes options for fixing and configuring your system. Options, which can break your system, are marked in red.
The last part offers options exclusive to Arch User Repository (AUR) management.


\e[1m00 - HELP
Display this help page.
This help page only gets displayed when entered from PacUIs user interface. If "pacui h" or "pacui -h" is executed in a terminal, a very short help page gets displayed. Quit this help page by pressing the Q key.


\e[1m0 - QUIT
\e[36m"clear && exit"
This will quit PacUI and clear your terminal. Scroll up to see all terminal output of your last PacUI session.


\e[1m1 - UPDATE SYSTEM
\e[36m"sudo pacman -Syu"
\e[36m"yaourt -Syua"
The first command compares a list of all installed packages with package database on your system repository mirror/server. If an updated package is available from your system repositories, it will get downloaded and installed on your system.
The second command does the same as the first part, but with one exception: It also downloads, compiles, and installs all packages from the Arch User Repository (AUR), which have an updated PKGBUILD file. The first command is still needed occasionaly, because major Pacman and Yaourt updates require "pacman -Syu" and will fail when started with Yaourt.
If updates from system repositories fail, the user is offered the choice to update packages using \e[36m"sudo pacman -Syu --force"\e[0m.
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: When a new version of an AUR package is available, sometimes the PKGBUILD file is not updated. If you want to install the latest version of a single AUR package, (re-)install it with INSTALL PACKAGES. If you want to install the latest versions of ALL AUR packages use FORCE UPDATE AUR.


\e[1m2 - MAINTAIN SYSTEM
\e[36m"sudo rm -r /tmp/*"
This command deletes the entire content of /tmp. PacUI uses this temporary directory to cache package lists and fzf selections. By deleting the /tmp directory, PacUI behaves exactly as after a reboot: Its first usage probably feels slower but any strange bugs and incompatibilities, e.g. originating from PacUI updates, should be gone.

\e[36m"sudo pacman-mirrors -f 0 && sudo pacman -Syy" \e[0m(for Manjaro)
This command generates a new mirrorslist of all available Manjaro repository mirrors/servers and sorts it by ping of up-to-date mirrors/servers. Additionally, the latest package database is downloaded from the chosen Manjaro repository mirror. If you want to speed up this command, it is recommended to only test your connection quality to Manjaro mirrors/servers near you. Example: You have noticed the pings to German and French mirrors are always best for you. Then, you can run: "sudo pacman-mirrors -c Germany,France".

\e[36m"sudo reflector -f 5 --sort age --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist && sleep 20 && sudo pacman -Syy" \e[0m(for Arch and other Arch-based distros)
This command generates a new mirrorslist of all available repository mirrors/servers. Then it resyncs database to match the mirrors.

\e[36m"sudo pacman -Rsn $(pacman -Qqdt)"
This option lists all orphaned packages on your system. Orphaned packages are old and no longer needed dependencies (packages not explicitly installed by you), which were never removed from your system.

\e[36m"sudo pacdiff"
A .pacnew file may be created during a package upgrade to avoid overwriting a file (e.g. a config file) which already exists and was previously modified by the user. A .pacsave file may be created during a package removal, or by a package installation (the package must be removed first). When the Pacman database has record that a certain file owned by the package should be backed up it will create a .pacsave file. These files require manual intervention from the user and it is good practice to handle them regularly. If left unhandled, improper configurations can result in improper function of the software, or the software being unable to run altogether.
This command offers you a choice, whether you want to keep the original file (in most cases, these are config files) or the .pacnew/.pacsave file. Simply view both files by choosing "v".
If you keep the original file, the program could not recognize the old syntax anymore, because it uses now a new syntax. In the worst case, your program could brake or stop working. If you remove the original file and use the new file without any changes, all your configurations might be reset to the default values. This can result in a changed system behavior, including removing passowrds or even sudo capability.
In most cases, the syntax does not change and you can simply remove the new file (with the default configuration settings).
If you notice a syntax change, it is highly recommended to solve this conflict in another way (e.g. by manually editing one of those files and deleting the other).
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: This command requires a default file difference viewer by setting the environment variable DIFFPROG. If this varialbe is not set, a minimal default is provided by PacUI using "diff".
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: In severe and rare cases, removing your old config file (and using the new .pacnew config file) OR keeping your old config file (and deleting the .pacnew config file) can result in a broken system. PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS WHEN USING THIS COMMAND!

\e[36m"sudo find -xtype l" \e[0m(only if there are broken symlinks)
This command displays a list of broken symbolic links on your system. These links are not deleted by default. You have to decide yourself what to do with them. When you have doubt about deleting them, leave them on your system. They can sometimes cause problems, but they use almost no hard drive space.
Symbolic links can be removed manually or "sudo find -xtype l -delete" can be used to remove all broken symbolic links.

\e[36m"pacman -Dk"
This command checks your local package repository for consistency and shows missing packages, dependencies, or other errors. Please refer to "man pacman" for a more detailed explanation.

\e[36m"comm -23 <(pacman -Qqm | sort) <(curl https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.gz | gzip -cd | sort)"
This command compares 2 lists: The first list contains packages, which were not installed from your system repository. The second list contains all AUR package names. By comparing these 2 lists, it is possible to find EOL packages, which will never receive any updates.
These EOL packages were either installed manually by the user or from the AUR (and have been removed from there in the meantime).
Unless you know exactly what you are doing, it is recommended to remove these EOL packages.

\e[36m"sudo journalctl --vacuum-size=50M --vacuum-time=30days"
This command limits all log files in journalctl to a combined size of 50 megabytes and a maximum age of 30 days. This leaves plenty of log files behind to analyze systematic and reoccuring errors while preventing excessive amounts of log files.

\e[36m"paccache -ruvk1"
\e[36m"paccache -rvk3"
By default Pacman uses this cache directory for downloading packages: /var/cache/pacman/pkg/ . No cached packages get deleted automatically. The package cache of an old and actively used installation can become quite large. Clean it to regain space on your root partition.
The first command removes all old packages from cache, which are not installed (anymore) on your system (except the latest version of that package).
The second command removes all old packages from cache except the 3 latest versions: The version you have currently installed on your system and 2 previous versions. Old package versions are kept to enable you to use ROLL BACK SYSTEM (or to manually downgrade packages) even without a working internet connection.

\e[36m"sudo pacman-optimize" \e[0m(only when installed on a HDD)
This command effectively defragments your Pacman database.
On traditional hard drives (HDD) this command can speed up all actions related to Pacman.
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: It is NOT recommended to use this command on modern solid state drives (SSDs)!

\e[36m"comm -13 <( pacman -Ssq "^linux" | grep "linux" | grep -E "^linux[0-9]*$|hardened$|lts$|zen$|rt-lts-manjaro$|rt-manjaro$" | sort ) <( for p in `command ls -1 /boot | grep -E '^vmlinuz'`; do pacman -Qqo /boot/$p | sort; done )"
This long "comm" command compares the output of 2 lists: The first list contains <KERNEL NAME> of available kernels in your repository and the second list contains <KERNEL NAME> of installed kernels.
By comparing both lists, it is possible to extract <KERNEL NAME> of so called end-of-live kernels. These installed kernels are no longer supported and do not receive updates anymore. Kernel modules are likely to break. It is highly recommended to remove these kernels.
Kernels from the AUR are also listed by the "comm" command. Please decide for yourself, whether you want to keep them or not.


\e[1m3 - INSTALL PACKAGES
\e[36m"yaourt -S <PACKAGE NAME>"
This option downloads and installs <PACKAGE NAME> on your system. The list of packages shows packages from your system repository with their description while package groups or packages from the AUR are only shown with their name.
If package installation from system repositories fails, the user is offered the choice to install packages using \e[36m"sudo pacman -S --force <PACKAGE NAME>"\e[0m.
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: Experienced users can install packages from the AUR without the need to answer questions all the time by using the command "yaourt -S <PACKAGE NAME> --noconfirm". The "--noconfirm" flag is great for quick and dirty installations of AUR packages on non-secure systems. Please keep always in mind that the AUR can contain any sort of package - including malicious and destructive (parts of) packages. Therefore, it is recommended to always check the PKGBUILD and .INSTALL file manually before installing a package from the AUR.


\e[1m4 - REMOVE PACKAGES + DEPS
\e[36m"sudo pacman -Rsn <PACKAGE NAME>"
This command removes <PACKAGE NAME> from your system including all dependencies, which are no longer needed by other packages. A copy of <PACKAGE NAME> will be kept in your package cache: Run MAINTAIN SYSTEM to remove it.
Please note that folders in your home (~) directory and created by the program <PACKAGE NAME> will not get removed from your system. Look for such folders in these places and remove them manually:
~/
~/.config/
~/.local/share/
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: If you want to display a list of all your installed packages (including their version number and description) use this PacUI option. Simply do not select <PACKAGE NAME> to be removed, but quit the list view with ESC or CTRL+C.
If package removal fails, the user is offered the choice to either try again or remove packages using \e[36m"pacman -Rdd <PACKAGE NAME>"\e[0m.
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: \e[36m"pacman -Rdd <PACKAGE NAME>"\e[0m does not check for dependencies before removing packages. In severe cases, this can leave your system without essential packages and thus unbootable!


\e[1m5 - DEPENDENCY TREE
\e[36m"pactree <PACKAGE NAME>"
\e[36m"pactree -s <PACKAGE NAME>"\e[0m(only for packages not installed on your system)
This command will display a complete tree of all dependencies of <PACKAGE NAME>. <PACKAGE NAME> can be an installed package or a package from your system repositories. Dependencies are packages required by <PACKAGE NAME> in order to function. When you install <PACKAGE NAME>, all its dependencies get installed, too.
Please note that all selected lines (toggle selection with your TAB key) will get added to file /tmp/pacui-t.


\e[1m6 - REVERSE DEPENDENCY TREE
\e[36m"pactree -r <PACKAGE NAME>"
This command will display a tree of installed packages, which depend on <PACKAGE NAME>. In other words: All displayed packages require <PACKAGE NAME> in order to function (properly).
Use this command when you want to know why you cannot remove <PACKAGE NAME> from your system.
Please note that all selected lines (toggle selection with your TAB key) will get added to file /tmp/pacui-rt.


\e[1m7 - LIST PACKAGE FILES
\e[36m"pacman -Ql <PACKAGE NAME>"
\e[36m"sudo pacman -Fyl <PACKAGE NAME>" \e[0m(only for packages not installed on your system)
These commands list all files contained in <PACKAGE NAME> including their path. The second command syncs the file database with your system repositories and then searches the file database for files, which get installed by <PACKAGE NAME>.
As a result the complete path to the files gets displayed.
Have you ever installed a program and did not know with which command it can be started/executed? Just look for files (and their names) in your /usr/bin/ directory using LIST PACKAGE FILES.
By default, the results are filtered for files located in usr/bin/, but you can enter any filter term you want to. Delete the default filter term with BACKSPACE to see a complete list of files of <PACKAGE NAME>. Please note that all selected lines (toggle selection with your TAB key) will get added to file /tmp/pacui-l.
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: On some systems, the file database has not been downloaded which results in an error message instead of search results from your system repositories. You can fix it by running "sudo pacman -Fyy" once and restarting LIST PACKAGE FILES.


\e[1m8 - SEARCH PACKAGE FILES
\e[36m"pacman -Ql | grep <FILE NAME>"
\e[36m"sudo pacman -Fysx <FILE NAME>" \e[0m(only for packages not installed on your system)
In some situations, Pacman (e.g. during UPDATE SYSTEM) cannot find a file, for example a shared library. An error message is shown about <FILE NAME>. Use SEARCH PACKAGE FILES to find out, which package has installed <FILE NAME>. In most cases, you can fix the Pacman error by using one of the following options on that package: UPDATE SYSTEM, ROLL BACK SYSTEM, FORCE REMOVE PACKAGES and INSTALL PACKAGES, or FORCE UPDATE SYSTEM.
SEARCH PACKAGE FILES is in many ways a reverse LIST PACKAGE FILES. You can use it to find out which package you have to install in order to use the <FILE NAME> command in your terminal.
The first command searches for <FILE NAME> in all your installed packages. <FILE NAME> can be only a part of an actual file name or contain regular expressions.
The second command syncs the file database with your system repositories and then searches the file database for <FILE NAME>.
As a result, <REPOSITORY>/<PACKAGE NAME> and the complete path to <FILE NAME> gets displayed using fzf. <PACKAGE NAME> is always printed in a bold font. <REPOSITORY> only gets displayed for packages, which are not installed on your system. Please note that all selected lines (toggle selection with your TAB key) will get added to file /tmp/pacui-s.
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: On some systems, the file database has not been downloaded which results in an error message instead of search results from your system repositories. You can fix it by running "sudo pacman -Fyy" once and restarting SEARCH PACKAGE FILES.


\e[1m9 - ROLL BACK SYSTEM
\e[36m"sudo pacman -Rdd <PACKAGE NAME> --noconfirm" \e[0m(only for rolling back package installations)
\e[36m"sudo pacman -U <PACKAGE NAME IN PACMAN/PACAUR CACHE> --noconfirm" \e[0m(only for rolling back package removals, upgrades, or downgrades.)
Manjaro and Arch Linux use a rolling release development model. This means ALL packages on your system continuously get updated to the latest version. Sometimes, things go wrong during UPDATE SYSTEM and you should roll back the last update. In case the latest version of a single package is broken, rolling back (a.k.a. downgrading) that package can work.
This command shows you a list of all recent Pacman actions sorted by date (using parts of this command: "tail -5000 /var/log/pacman.log"). Please select all Pacman actions you want to roll back. Installed packages will be removed from your system. Removed packages will be reinstalled as the latest version available in your Pacman/Pacaur cache. Upgraded packages will be downgraded to the previous version (if this version is available in your local Pacman/Pacaur cache). Downgraded packages will be Upgraded to a later version. If you select multiple upgrades/downgrades of the same package, the package gets downgraded/upgraded multiple times (if this version is available in your local Pacman/Pacaur cache).
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: It is strongly recommended to always roll back <PACKAGE NAME> including ALL its dependencies. Otherwise, your system could be left in a broken state. If you are in doubt about that, rolling back all changes made on your system in a short time intervall should be sufficient.
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: After downgrading a broken package to a working version, it is recommended to add the package name to your Ignore List ( "IgnorePkg" option in /etc/pacman.conf ). This will prevent Pacman from showing any available updates for this package. The package needs to be removed manually from your Ignore List in order to receive automatic updates again. Alternatively, you can run future updates with the command "sudo pacman -Syu --ignore <PACKAGE NAME>" until a fixed version of that package gets released.


\e[31;1m10 - FIX PACMAN ERRORS
Multiple commands attempt to fix the most common issues Manjaro users have with Pacman. This should also work for Arch-based distributions, but to a lesser degree. Force options (as in FORCE UPDATE SYSTEM) are excluded, even though they are essential in fixing some problems.
Please make sure that your root partition is not full. If you have doubts about this, run MAINTAIN SYSTEM before FIX PACMAN ERRORS.
A working internet connection is required for FIX PACMAN ERRORS!

\e[36m"sudo rm -r /tmp/*"
This command deletes the entire content of /tmp. PacUI uses this temporary directory to cache package lists and fzf selections. By deleting the /tmp directory, PacUI behaves exactly as after a reboot: Its first usage probably feels slower but any strange bugs and incompatibilities, e.g. originating from PacUI updates, should be gone.

\e[36m"sudo unlink /var/lib/pacman/db.lck"
This command removes Pacmans database lock. The database lock prevents multiple Pacman instances from running at the same time and interfering with each other.
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: Only run this command when no other Pacman instance (e.g. Pacman, Yaourt, Pamac, Octopi, PacmanXG4, ...) is running.

\e[36m"sudo pacman-mirrors -f 0 && sudo pacman -Syy" \e[0m(for Manjaro)
This command generates a new mirrorslist of all available Manjaro repository mirrors/servers and sorts it by ping of up-to-date mirrors/servers. Additionally, the latest package database is downloaded from the chosen Manjaro repository mirror. If you want to speed up this command, it is recommended to only test your connection quality to Manjaro mirrors/servers near you. Example: You have noticed the pings to German and French mirrors are always best for you. Then, you can run: "sudo pacman-mirrors -c Germany,France".

\e[36m"sudo reflector -f 5 --sort age --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist && sleep 20 && sudo pacman -Syy" \e[0m(For Arch and other Arch-based distros)
This command generates a new mirrorslist of all available repository mirrors/servers. Then it resyncs database to match the mirrors.

\e[36m"sudo dirmngr </dev/null"
Sometimes during key management the package "dirmngr" outputs error messages, which interrupt key management processes (such as the following commands). This command prevents any output from "dirmngr".

\e[36m"sudo sed -i 's/SigLevel[ ]*=/SigLevel = Never #/' /etc/pacman.conf "
The following commands delete and reinstall some essential packages. If your keyring is broken, no packages could be installed because of a key mismatch. Therefore, it is important to disable Pacman's key check before continuing.
This command disables the signature key check of packages by Pacman.

\e[36m"sudo systemctl stop ntpd.service"
This command stops (temporarily) the Network Time Protocol daemon service NTPD (if it is installed and running). In case NTPD is not installed, the output is ignored.
This is the first command of a series of commands, which try to set the system and hardware clock on your computer (ignoring time zone and daylight saving time). An (almost) correct system time is needed for checking and importing keys or fingerprints later on in the fixing process!

\e[36m"sudo pacman -Sy ntp"
This command (re-)installs the "ntp" package. PacUI actually does not use this command but instead downloads and installs this package manually in order to bypass key database and key chain errors.
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: PacUI will fail if you cannot install any packages on your system anymore due to key database and key chain errors AND "ntp" was not installed on your system before. As long as your system clock is set (almost) correct, you do not have to worry about it. But if your system clock is set completely wrong AND you cannot install any packages on your system anymore AND "ntp" was not installed on your system before, you have to set your system clock manually before you run PacUIs "fix" command. You can do this with the following command:
sudo timedatectl set-time "yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss"
( example: sudo timedatectl set-time "2018-01-26 11:13:54" )

\e[36m"sudo ntpd -qg && sleep 60 && sudo hwclock -w"
The first command starts the just (re-)installed Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd.service). Next, your system clock is set. Finally, the ntpd.service is quit.
The second command makes your system wait for 60 seconds. This is done as precaution to ensure your system has enough time to connect to an internet or network server and set the system clock.
The third command is only run when the first and second command have been successfully finished. It writes the time from your system clock to your hardware clock.
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: The last command is needed in order to prevent another services on your system to set your system clock according to your hardware clock in regular intervals. This may result in a hardware clock, which is not set to UTC anymore and/or a system clock, which shows the wrong time. If you encounter this problem read the Arch Linux Wiki article about time: "https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Time"

\e[36m"sudo rm -r /etc/pacman.d/gnupg"
This command deletes your key database. It does not output an error in case the package "gnupg" is not installed on your system.
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: This command will remove all keys from your system, including manually installed keys (with "sudo pacman-key --lsign-key <KEY>"). Please remember to reinstall those keys again after FIX PACMAN ERRORS has completed!

\e[36m"sudo pacman -Sy gnupg $(pacman -Qsq '(-keyring)' | grep -v -i -E '(gnome|python|debian)' | paste -sd " " )"
This command (re-)installs the gnupg and keyring packages. PacUI actually does not use this command but instead downloads and installs this package manually in order to bypass key database and key chain errors.

\e[36m"sudo sed -i 's/SigLevel = Never #/SigLevel =/' /etc/pacman.conf "
This command enables the signature check of packages by Pacman again.
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: If this command fails or the PacUI script is exited after the signature check has been disabled and this command, it is highly recommended to manually check your /etc/pacman.conf file and remove all "Never #" strings you can find. Only by doing this, you can trust package installations on your system again!

\e[36m"sudo pacman-key --init && sudo pacman-key --populate $(pacman -Qsq '(-keyring)' | grep -v -i -E '(gnome|python|debian)' | sed 's/-keyring//' | paste -sd " " )"
These two commands create a fresh key for you and import and (re-)install all keyrings. This will solve problems with your local key database and your distro's and Arch's key database. Such problems can occur when new new Arch Linux or your distro packagers get added, for example.
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: This command might take a long time to complete. If your system appears to stop or hang, it searches for entropy in order to generate a new key for you. In this case, it might help to do file operations with a lot of reads and/or writes per minute (such as searching for files, copying large directories, etc.). Alternatively, you can open a browser and do some heavy surfing (with a lot of mouse movements, mouse klicks, and keyboard key presses): This can help to generate entropy much faster.

\e[36m"echo 'keyring /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/pubring.gpg' >> $HOME/.gnupg/gpg.conf"
There are 2 different places in Arch Linux and Manjaro to store keys: One place is used by Pacman and the other gets used by GPG.
This command imports all keys for Pacman into GPG. This essentially means that the user trusts all Arch Linux Trusted Users and your distro's developers. After that, you will be able to install AUR packages from Arch Linux Trusted Users and your distro's developers without the need to import those keys (again) manually.

\e[36m"sudo pacman -Sc"
After an unseccessful attempt to update your system (which quits with a key error), you might have already downloaded unsigned (or wrongly signed) packages to your Pacman cache. These packages cannot be installed anymore.
This command removes all packages from your Pacman cache, which are not installed on your system. Afterwards, you need to download all previously downloaded but not installed packages again.
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: This command makes it impossible to ROLL BACK SYSTEM on systems without an internet connection.

\e[36m"sudo pacman -S --needed libsystemd systemd-sysvcompat systemd && sleep 30"
The first command updates - if necessary - systemd including important components before all other packages are updated. This is necessary, because sometimes a successful update of systemd causes a short crash on some systems, which prevents a successful update of all other packages.
The second command simply does nothing for 30 seconds before the update of all other packages get started. It is only here as precaution.

\e[36m"sudo pacman -Syyuu"
This last command forces a redownload of the latest package database from the best repository mirror. Then, all your installed packages are checked against this latest package database. If an updated package is available from your system repositories, it will get downloaded and installed on your system. If an installed package is newer than the same package in your system repositories, the installed package will get downgraded. This behavior ensures your packages are always in sync with your system repositories, even if you have just switched the repository mirror or switched from branches.

\e[36m"sudo pacman -Suu"
This command makes abolutely sure all downloaded packages get installed and downgraded if necessary. The user has to manually allow downgrades of packages, if downgrades are available.

\e[36m"sudo pacman -Fyy"
This command forces a sync of the file database of your system repository with your used repository mirror server. The file database is separate from the package database. The file database enables SEARCH PACKAGE FILES and LIST PACKAGE FILES of packages, which are not installed on your system but only available on your system repository.


\e[1m11 - EDIT CONFIG FILES
\e[36m"$EDITOR <FILE NAME>"
This command opens <FILE NAME> in your default text editor. You can choose between multiple important system configuration files. Files in the root directory are opened with root privileges. The "sudoers" file is edited with the help of "visudo". For some configuration files, additional commands are executed after the text editor is closed.
By default the text editor Nano gets used, except a custom $EDITOR variable has been exported. In the text editor Nano, Press CTRL+O to save your changes, ENTER to choose a directory, and CTRL+X to quit Nano.
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: Changing system configuration files can harm or even destroy your system. In some cases, this can happen with a single mistake. Be extremely careful and always double check your changes before saving and rebooting - especially when editing the files marked in red! It is recommended to search the Arch Wiki for the configuration file you want to edit and read about available and recommended settings.


\e[1m12 - LIST PACKAGES BY SIZE
\e[36m"expac -Q '%m - %n %v' | sort -n -r "
This command lists packages on your system sorted by their installation size. Both explicitly installed packages and dependencies are displayed. Important system packages part of the "base" or "base-devel" group are not displayed. Please note that all selected lines (toggle selection with your TAB key) will get added to file /tmp/pacui-ls.

\e[1m13 - FORCE UPDATE AUR
\e[36m"yaourt -Syua && yaourt -Syua --devel --needed --noconfirm"
The Arch User Repository (AUR) is a repository of (mostly) PKGBUILD files. Everybody can create such a PKGBUILD file and upload it to the AUR. A PKGBUILD file contains simple and human readable instructions like where to download the source code from, what dependencies are needed, where to copy files for installation, etc. Yaourt is a so called AUR Helper: It can interpret PKGBUILD files and download the source code, install dependencies, build files on your system, and copy these files to the right location (a.k.a. installing a program).
By checking a PKGBUILD file (and .INSTALL file) you can make sure the source code is loaded from an official download server, no harmful dependencies get installed, and the installation instructions do not contain harmful code.
A lot of PKGBUILD files contain variables (e.g. program version) in download addresses; this makes them download always the latest source code (e.g. from Github) during installation. Some PKGBUILD files contain no variables: These PKGBUILD files need to be changed manually every time a new program version is released.
The first command of FORCE UPDATE AUR does the same as the second command of UPDATE SYSTEM: Only AUR packages with updated/changed PKGBUILD files will get updated. This gives you the chance to check these updated/changed PKGBUILD files.
The second command of FORCE UPDATE AUR forces a reinstall of ALL your developmental AUR packages (i.e. all git, svn, and cvs-packages). These kinds of AUR packages are usually never updated/reinstalled with a simple "yaourt -Syua". The "--noconfirm" flag is used in a secure way, because no PKGBUILD files have changed since the first command got executed.
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: This might take a long time! When using Yaourt, after every 15min this command will pause and ask again for your password.

\e[1m14 - LIST INSTALLED FROM AUR
\e[36m"pacman -Qm"
This command lists all installed packages, which are from the AUR or which were manually installed. Please note that all selected lines (toggle selection with your TAB key) will get added to file /tmp/pacui-la.
If you want a list of all installed packages use REMOVE PACKAGES + DEPS as described in this Help Page.

\e[1mDOWNGRADE PACKAGES
\e[36m"downgrade <PACKAGE NAME>"
Manjaro and Arch Linux use a rolling release development model. This means ALL packages on your system continuously get updated to the latest version. If the latest version of a packages does not work on your system, you can downgrade that package to an earlier, working version.
This command downgrades <PACKAGE NAME> and offers you a list of old <PACKAGE NAME> versions to choose from. This list includes all old <PACKAGE NAME> versions from your local package cache and online sources (if you have a working internet connection).
After a successful downgrade, you can add <PACKAGE NAME> to your Ignore List ( "IgnorePkg" option in /etc/pacman.conf ). This will prevent Pacman from showing any available updates for <PACKAGE NAME>. <PACKAGE NAME> needs to be removed manually from your Ignore List in order to receive automatic updates of <PACKAGE NAME> again.
Alternatively, you can run future updates with the command "sudo pacman -Syu --ignore <PACKAGE NAME>" until a fixed version of <PACKAGE NAME> gets released.
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: Be careful when using Manjaro and downgrading to <PACKAGE NAME> from online sources, because these are old versions from the Arch Linux repositories only: In the worst case, this can brake your system! Therefore, it is recommended to limit downgrading to (old versions of) local packages, if possible.
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: Downgrading to a working version of <PACKAGE NAME> can break your system in in rare cases like the following: The latest system update has replaced a dependency of <PACKAGE NAME> with a different package and <PACKAGE NAME> is an important system package. Downgrading <PACKAGE NAME> will NOT reinstall the dependency of <PACKAGE NAME>, because it conflicts with the already installled different package. This can result in a broken system. Please keep these kind of conflicts in mind when using DOWNGRADE PACKAGES.
\e[1mAttention\e[0m: DOWNGRADE PACKAGES will show you a selection of packages you can downgrade. If you are using Pacaur to install AUR packages, you will not be able to downgrade AUR packages using DOWNGRADE PACKAGES! instead, the ROLL BACK SYSTEM option is recommended.

\e[1mSEARCH + INSTALL FROM AUR
\e[36m"yaourt <PACKAGE NAME>"
This command searches for <PACKAGE NAME> in all system repositories and the Arch User Repository (AUR). It searches for package names and package descriptions.
Example: You can search for "web browser" and you will find Firefox and other web browsers. One or multiple search results can be installed on your system.
If you want to exit this mode without installing any packages, simply press CTRL+C or ENTER.
